# 3D-object-converter-OBJ-to-JS-array-
Javascript program that converts a .obj file into Javascript arrays of vertices and indices and writes it into HTML.

Instructions:
Export Blender models with option: triangulate faces and include UV's in order for it to work - then copy the HTML content and save it as Javascript file, as Javascript cannot write to disk for security reasons.
